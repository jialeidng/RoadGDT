This set of scripts prepare the images to be used for creating labelled sparse PC

1. delete_every_other_image.py
    - simple script that deletes every other image in a folder.
    - only really used if images need to be cut.
    - can also change to delete the nth images in a folder.

2. create_mask.py
    - To be used in PC reconstruction
    - create_mask.py generates a mask that removes any labels that are not relevant, such as the sky or buildings.

3. fuse_seg.py
    - generates a mask that excludes everything except for the roadmarkings.
    - where the mask is zero, set value to [0,0,0], i.e., black.
    - adds roadmarkings to segmented images through addition.
    - generates images in folder MERGED, which is what will be used
