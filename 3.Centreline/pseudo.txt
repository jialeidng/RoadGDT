# open image
# draw single line through it
#   question: where to draw the line?
#   question: better to have several lines or just the one line?

# find out how to find boundaries
# put boundaries in a list:

select the relevant boundary
- select first pixel
    - check if the boundary is the same as the previous
        - if yes:
            go to next,
    - check if one of the pixels are on the list of road boundaries
        if no:
            go to next
    -  add pixel NOT on boundary to list


# test in future with three lines: close, middle and far
