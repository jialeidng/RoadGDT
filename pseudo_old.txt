# import 3D library

# import PC with only road data

# fit principal lign through it
# draw horisontals every x distance

# minimise widths, get the final trajectory of the road

# select sections with width changes
    # for sudden jumps
    # for gradual increases

# cut PC into sections using widths


# FIRST TEST IF SPARSE PC IS SUFFICIENT, otherwise, proceed:

# find images tha correspond to each section
# list images

# these images can be used to generate a dense PC
